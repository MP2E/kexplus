# KexPlus Engine

KexPlus is a fork of the Doom64 EX source port engine that aims to provide a portable,
readable, and modern source port of Doom64. Compatibility with Doom64 is a priority,
however limit removing features, and new features for mappers, are planned for the future.

C++ rewrite planned for 3.0 release, check TODO for more info
