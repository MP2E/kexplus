To Do List for KexPlus
======================
Immediate:
- Fix bugs
- SDL2 (IN PROGRESS)
- Menu for dynamic video resolution changing/fullscreen (IN PROGRESS)
- OS X build
- OpenGL ES renderer merge
- SDL2 joypad input

3.0(pending):
- Do extensive testing with valgrind, clang cpp analzyer, and aggressive compiler optimizations and investigate bugs(aka scaling bug with LTO)
- Draft up a style guide for consistent C++ code with Kaiset
- Rename everything to cpp files and start C++ port
- Use classes for obvious cases where it would benefit code clarity(mobj)
- We need to create a testcase suite to be able to test kexplus for compatibility with correct doom64 behaviour
