To Do List for KexPlus
======================
Immediate:
- Fix all compiler warnings
- Fix bugs in macro system
- Fix shoot-while-saving bug
- Fix title screen being superimposed on TITLEMAP on second playthrough
- Fix any remaining gameplay or stability issues
- Make backport patches for easy importing into Kex

3.0(pending):
- Do extensive testing with valgrind, clang cpp analzyer, and aggressive compiler optimizations and investigate bugs(aka scaling bug with LTO)
- Draft up a style guide for consistent C++ code with Kaiset
- Rename everything to cpp files and start C++ port
- Use classes for obvious cases where it would benefit code clarity(mobj)
- We need to create a testcase suite to be able to test kexplus for compatibility with correct doom64 behaviour
- SDL2 port(from Kex2)
- aim for GLES2.0/GL2.0 compliance?
- test on obscure architectures for endian-ness issues and anything else(ARM Linux anyone?)
